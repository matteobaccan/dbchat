# Creating Charts and Graphs from Database Data with Claude Desktop

## üéØ Overview

The Database MCP Server combined with Claude Desktop can create beautiful, interactive charts and graphs directly from your database data. Claude can query your database, analyze the results, and generate visualizations in real-time.

## üîß How It Works

1. **Query Database** - Claude uses the MCP server to fetch data from your database
2. **Analyze Data** - Claude processes and understands the data structure
3. **Generate Visualization** - Claude creates interactive charts using web technologies
4. **Interactive Results** - You get live, interactive charts you can explore

## üìä Types of Visualizations Available

Claude can create various chart types using libraries like:
- **Line Charts** - Time series, trends, progression
- **Bar Charts** - Comparisons, categories, rankings
- **Pie Charts** - Proportions, distributions
- **Scatter Plots** - Relationships, correlations
- **Area Charts** - Cumulative data, stacked values
- **Heat Maps** - Pattern visualization, correlations
- **Histograms** - Data distribution, frequency
- **Box Plots** - Statistical summaries

## üé® Example Visualization Requests

### Sales Analytics
```
"Query our sales database and create a line chart showing monthly revenue for the last 12 months"

"Show me a bar chart of our top 10 customers by total order value"

"Create a pie chart showing the distribution of orders by product category"
```

### Business Intelligence
```
"Pull data from the users table and create a chart showing user signups by month over the past year"

"Generate a scatter plot showing the relationship between order value and customer age"

"Create a heat map showing sales performance by region and month"
```

### Operational Dashboards
```
"Query the inventory table and show me a bar chart of current stock levels by product category"

"Create a line chart showing website traffic trends from our analytics table"

"Generate a stacked area chart showing revenue breakdown by product line over time"
```

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Example

Let's walk through creating a sales revenue chart:

### 1. Ask Claude for a Visualization
```
"Can you query our sales database and create a chart showing monthly revenue for 2024? Use the orders table where we have order_date and total_amount columns."
```

### 2. Claude's Process
Claude will:
1. Use the MCP server to query: `SELECT DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') as month, SUM(total_amount) as revenue FROM orders WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024 GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') ORDER BY month`
2. Analyze the returned data
3. Create an interactive chart artifact

### 3. Result
You'll get an interactive line chart showing monthly revenue trends that you can:
- Hover over data points for exact values
- Zoom in/out on specific time periods
- Export or save the chart
- Modify styling and colors

## üìà Advanced Visualization Examples

### Multi-Series Charts
```
"Create a line chart comparing monthly sales between different product categories using our orders and products tables"
```

### Real-Time Dashboards
```
"Build a dashboard showing:
1. Total sales today (number)
2. Orders by hour (bar chart) 
3. Top selling products (pie chart)
4. Revenue trend over last 30 days (line chart)"
```

### Statistical Analysis
```
"Query customer data and create a histogram showing the distribution of customer lifetime values"

"Generate a box plot comparing order values across different customer segments"
```
